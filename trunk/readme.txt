== Description ==

This Wordpress plugin can help you to boost your rank in search engines.
You can add META tags like keywords and descriptions to your posts and pages and makes them unique.
Your post/page titles get optimized (actual title first, then blog name), this is independent of your theme so you don't have to touch code.

META tags are extracted from your posts/pages like this:

* Your categories become your META keywords.
* Your excerpt is used as META description (*put effort into that one, it will pay off!*)
* Your titles are rewritten. Actual post title comes first, then your blog name. Not the other way round.
* "Filler Pages" like archives and categories are excluded from indexing to avoid duplicate content.
* Additional custom fields named "keywords" and "description" are taken into account for backwards compatibility with
[Another Wordpress Meta Plugin](http://wp.uberdose.com/2006/11/04/another-wordpress-meta-plugin/).

The recommended way to add keywords is to simply add categories to a post, but you can also put them into the respective field below your
post content.
