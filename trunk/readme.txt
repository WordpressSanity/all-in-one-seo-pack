Optimizes your Wordpress blog for Search Engines (Search Engine Optimization).

== Description ==

Optimizes your Wordpress blog for Search Engines (Search Engine Optimization) by generating META tags, optimizing your titles
and avoiding indexing of duplicate content.

META tags are generated like this:

* Your categories become your META keywords, followed by any additional keywords you specify in the keywords field
for your post or page (edit one or create a new one, it's right below where you insert your post content).
* Your excerpt is used as META description. *This is very important* since most
search engines show this as content snippet in their search engine results pages (SERPs). So it's the first thing many users will see of
your blog. *Please note*: You have to provide an excerpt to get a META description.
* If there is no excerpt, the custom field named "description" is taken into account. This is for backwards compatibility with
[Another Wordpress Meta Plugin](http://wp.uberdose.com/2006/11/04/another-wordpress-meta-plugin/).
* You can set your home page descriptions under "Options" -> "All in One SEO".

In addition to generating META tags the following optimizations are done (some of which are optional,
see *Options - All in One SEO* in your admin panel):

* Your titles are rewritten. Actual post title comes first, then your blog name (separated with "|"). Not the other way round. You don't
have to touch your template! Never ever have "Archive" appear before your precious post title!
* "Filler Pages" like archives and categories are excluded from indexing to avoid duplicate content.
