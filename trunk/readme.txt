Adds META tags like keywords and descriptions to your posts and pages.

== Description ==

META tags are extracted from your posts/pages like this:

* Your categories become your META keywords.
* Your excerpt is used as META description (put effort into that one, it will pay off).
* Additional custom fields named "keywords" and "description" are taken into account for backwards compatibility with Another Wordpres
Meta Plugin.
* Your titles are rewritten. Actual post title comes first, then your blog name. Not the other way round.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `all_in_one_seo_pack.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it! Don't forget to write good excerpts :)

Here's a link to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software") and one to [Markdown's Syntax Documentation][markdown syntax].
Titles are optional, naturally.

[markdown syntax]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
